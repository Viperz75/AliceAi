1. To give command after running the program just say "Wake up". Otherwise it won't take any commands.

2. To make it sleep just say "go to sleep". It will go to sleep but won't exit. In sleep mode it won't perform any commands. If you again say "Wake up" then it will again take commands.

3. To exit the program just say "good bye'. It will then exit the program.
